Differentiated Instruction (Rachel)
    Some kids are ahead, some are behind, others are in between
    Differentiated Instruction is the process of providing unique support to an individual or small group of students with the goal of maximizing success of each student
    Differentiation is:
        Planned, not an afterthought
        A value-add, not a time killer
        Focused on helping students grow and learn, not catch up or slow down

    Differentiation is not:
        Extra or reduced work (without shifting complexity, style, etc.)
            Even for extra credit
        Providing answers with "time is up"

    Review - Bloom's Taxonomy
        A lot of CS work hits right in the middle: Application
        Shifting up or down on the Taxonomy is a simple but effective way to differentiate
        Bloom's taxonomy
            Create
            Evaluate
            Analyze
            Apply
            Understand
            Remember

        Examples of moving up:
            Create their own problems and solve them
            Help another student
            Different examples of a for loop
            How to make a sprite jump without using the move block
            What kinds of problems are suited to arrays or lists

        Examples of moving down:
            Ask to define the concept before using it
            Here's a for loop: what does it do?
            How to make cod run multiple times?

        Classroom example
            During lab you find that
                5 students don't understand loops at all
                15 are handling the lab just fine
                5 finished the lab in 10 minutes and are now bored

            How did you find out that this was the situation?
                Formative assessment

            What can you do with students behind
                Learning style??  visual, audio, kinethetic
                Group similar students
                Check their notebooks
                Review previous assignments

                Ask them to explain what they're thinking
                Get other students to help them
                Relate the lesson to previous learning

            What can you do with students who are finished?
                Give more challenging assignments
                Ask them to correct an erroneous program
                Ask them to break things
                Give them a more complex example
                Pick a topic and have them explain where loops could be used
                Make sure that they're not disruptive

                Do additional formative assessment
                Have them apply that knowledge

                Ask them to help other students

            What can you do to help students who hit this regularly?
                Teach them to cope with this themselves
                Assess your instructional style
                Ask them to think about what they did previously
                Pair them with different classes of students
                Try to find out the root cause of the problem

        This is a marketing problem
        How to measure?
        How to fix?
        How to market to underserved?
        Why have weed out programs?

    Other types of diversity
        Learning styles
        Disabilities
        Socio-economic background
        Previous experience
        Native language
        Sexuality
        Religion
        Age

    Diversity in Technical Roles
        Gender female 18%
        Ethnic
            8% African American

    Strategies
        Get to know your students
            Don't make assumptions
        Be aware of examples that aren't relevant or interesting
        Develop an identity of computer scientists for the whole class
        Set expectations high for everyone
            Give positive reinforcement and encouragement

        You don't neec to be an expert, but be aware

Dealing with failure
    CS is different
        Computer science classes are different than many other classes
            No single right answer, but not completely open-ended
            Rarely don the first time, but clear criteria for completeness and correctness
            Completely new concepts, but high expectations

    Student struggles
        Many students struggle with failure
            Schools have often trained students to expect success immediately or not at all
        Frustration, disappointment, and fear are common
        Outside pressure to contribute
            From parents, administrators, media, etc.

        Find the source of frustration and addess it head on
        Identify, empathize, strategize

        Student personas
            Scared puppy -- empathize, give them a strategy for dealing with problems, emotional reassurance

            Perfectionist -- talk to them about developing a skill rather than results, iterative development, its about growth and struggle is part of the journey, struggle is part of programming, give them examples of experts failing

            Hustler -- it's about the skill not the grade, find out why hustling

            Pessimist -- self-evaluate, talk about what they already know, reassure that struggle is part of the process, you deserve to learn the skill, 

            Opportunist -- be aware of what's going on

            Show-off -- 

Grading
    Why do we give grades?
        So people can know accomplishment or skill level.
        To guide further instruction?
        To reward or punish
    Who is/are the audiences for the grades?
        Students
        Parents
        Future teachers
    Do your answers to the above depend on where or when grades are given?
        At the end, it's purely assessment
        In the interim, it's more feedback to show where to improve

    Motivating students with grades
        Provide mechanisms to improve or offset bad grades
            Test/quiz retakes
            Project improvements
            Makeup work

        Require commitment from students
            If all homework is complete, drop lowest test score
            If exptra practice s done, final exam can replace projects

        Make individual deals as needed
        Be aware of school/classroom rules

    Grading techniques
        Rubrics
        Written feedback
        Complete/incomplete
        Correct/Incorrect
        Corrections
        Peer grading
        Self grading
        Instructor grading
        Face-to-face grading

        Level of effort
        Amount of improvement
        Reward for showing process
        Reward correcting mistakes
        Written feedback

    Peer Grading
        Students get to see the assignment three times
        Evaluate two students' understanding of one assignment

        Don't take peer grades on faith
        Do spot-check peer grading results

    Corrections
        Provide students opportunity to learn from mistakes
        Make instructor feedback actionable

    Calibration
        Lots of grading, but lots of you
        Take turns
        Grade a few assignments, compare
        Split submissions

        AP CS
            20% for homework and daily labs
            40% for projects and large scal labes
            40% for Tests and quizzes

        Intro CS

Academic Honesty in CS
    The objective for each student is to learn computer science
    Create a clear policy based on school requirements
    Review the policy during the first few days of school
    Post with the Syllabus on LMS or website

    Use face-to-face grading of projects
    Have students answer reflection questionsl on lab submissions
    Investigate unexpected differences

    Follow through on polic
    Classroom teacher will involve parents and admins as necessary

        Make a plan for which students need to be visited first when lab starts
        Check to see who hasn't turned into an assignment yet
        Work with classroom teacher helping them learn the materials

    At the end of the day, remote teaching is not as different from local teaching as you might think.  Call your regional manager before you go crazy

    Communication
        Teaching voice
            not just what you say but how you deliver it
            Different from your day-to-day voice
            vocal variety
            Affects students attension
            Especially important for remote teachers

        Componnts of teacher voice
            Pitch -- record yourself and listen
            Tempo/rate
            Volume
            Prosody (rhythm)
            Don't forget: wait time!

        Word Choice
            that's wrong     that's not quite right
            fix it           try again
            who's not done yet   who's still working
            it's much better than it was    you're making great progress
            Raise your hand if you don't get it -- Raise your had if you'd like to hear it again

        Tone
            Compassion -- warm, friendly, inviting, open
            Authority -- Firm, clear, strict, no- nonsense
            Engagement -- Projected, varied, enthusiastic

        Bonus activity -- record yourself delivering a lesson

        Body language is important

        Packet activity
            Find a partner
            For each scenario, one partner will be a student; the other will be a teacher/TA
            Respond to the student with empathy
            Think about your tone, body language, and word choice
