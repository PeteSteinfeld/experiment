Eileen Boerger, John, Terrel, Pete, Kathy, Andrew, Pete

Start at 8:25

Strengths
    1 TechStart brand
    2 Experienced educators -- teachers, administration, kids
    3 Connection with OCSTA and the education community

    Familiarity with existing programs (OGPC, ORTOP, ...)
    Connection with industry
    Connection with government, policy, fundraising
    Connection with education
    Personal reputation
    Success stories
    Standards for how to teach CS

Weaknesses
    1  New organization and we need to raise awareness, we're not really new, but we're different, we need to be able to tell our history
        Gap in service between what we were and what we're doing now -- people took us in a different direction for a while
    2  Lack of sustainable funding -- no sustained financial base, we have no funds right now

    New influence reach -- will be able to reach people that OCSTA will not
    We need a board that reflects what we want to accomplish, we need diversity
    Lack of fundraising experience (John has some)
    Need marketing
    Many board members are full time employed already
    No connection with Intel (and other large industry reps)
    Lack of well defined goals
    no customer relation system (CRM)
    no business plan
    no business model
    no marketing plan
    limited number of SQ instructors
	SQ's are very disconnected (in terms of planning and content)
        need to find out what people want
        need consistency of how to instruct

	Much of the SQ content is repeat, lack of incentive for teachers to come back each year, lack of marketed variety
    We don't have a clean line for 

Opportunities
    1 Make TechStart be the goto nexus for K12 CS education
        Be the most knowledgeable, successful, powerful org for CS education in Oregon
    2 More deeply connect industry and education, expand and engage
        Industry needs more tech talent so the opportunity for partnerships is big
        More closely align industry and class structure and content
        Bring industry and teachers together
            have industry teach SQ, coach OGPC, ORTOP
    3  Get more CS teachers
        Expand training for existing teachers and SQ instructors
        Recruit new teachers

    Build a robust SalesForce database
    Set up a website that promotes collaboration

    Establish an overall curriculum
    Leverage CS4All
    Expand to CTE and general TechEd
    Influence industry
    Capture stories
    Collaborate with other tech ed organizations
    Use more online stuff
        PLCs and online has helped us
    We're in a favorable environment for CS education
    Financial
        Establish deep relationships with tech industry ($125K what we used to have)
        Go after grants (industry and government)
    Partner more deeply with CTE orgs (school districts, ESDs, STEM hubs)
    Create pathways for internships for teachers and students (Saturday Academy, BEC, Intel, IBM, TEALS)
    Set up scalable models for setting up curricula
    Measure 98 will require schools to get more CTE teachers, we can provide training, mentoring
    Provide a community
    CS teachers retiring, brain trust is changing

Threats
    1  Funding
        Competition for money, we don't want to get lost in the crowd
        Sustainability
    2  Competition for customer attention such as teachers doing PD, we don't want to get lost in the crowd and stay above the noise
    3  The political/economic/educational/social environment is changing


    No state standards for CS
    No requirements for teaching CS in schools
    CS stakeholder community loses attraction to CS if we don't show results
    On line training could eat into our base (we need to know who our customers are)  -- this is also an opportunity

    Dilution of our mission
    Brain trust retirement, CS teachers retiring, brain trust is changing
    Losing sight of the co-mission of OCSTA and TechStart (don't repeat the past)
    We make our mission/goals to rigid

=====================================
Goals
    1 $1M annual operating budget by 2025

    2 Increase number of schools that offer information technology, computer science, and engineering
        Metrics
        High schools that offer one or more coding classes
            Get to 50% by 2020
            Get to 80% by 2025

            Currently 1%
            Increase to 3%

    3 Increase the number of people teaching information technology, computer science, and engineering
        Metrics
            increase by 5% per year
            We're not currently measuring that
            69 high schools offer coding courses

    4 Support existing teachers to expand and enhance their knowledge base
        Support 400 per year

    5 Increase the number of people going on to pursue degrees in CS and tech education generally
        This is hard to measure
