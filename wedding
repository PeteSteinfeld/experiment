================================
I'm Pete Steinfeld, Aly's father.

Thank you all for coming to Adrian and Aly's wedding.  These last few days it's been a real pleasure to get to know everyone better.  I got to talk history with Julian, I got buttered up by Eric.  I got to talk rock and roll with Cally.  I got to talk about computer programming with Zubin.  I had the experience of Mary Ann asking my permission to clean up the dishes after dinner.  Mary Ann, I'm not sure where you learned that move, but you're welcome to have dinner at our house any time.  I got to cook with Laura.  Jess and Dan let me bore them with stories that they've already heard.  As far as I'm concerned, life doesn't get much sweeter than this.

But the best part was being with Jan.  Every once in a while, I have step back and think about how lucky I am to be married to her.  So much of this wedding, our dinners, my life, happened because of Jan.  

Jan listens to my crazy ideas and she lets me know when I'm about to do something especially stupid.  But more importantly, Jan she helps me succeed at doing really difficult things.  When I get lost, Jan helps me find my way.  And for the people who know Jan and me well know that this is a regular occurrence.  

Sir Galahad said, "My strength is as the strength of ten because my heart is pure".  Well, I feel like my strength is as the strength of ten because I'm married to Jan.  

I know that Jan has my back.  And I appreciate it.  Thank you, Jan.

Now that Adrian and Aly are married, I'm looking forward, to continuing to share a part of their lives and to watching them create their own future.  I plan to help them out when I can, but I suspect that they won't need much help.

That's because when I see Adrian and Aly together, I see the same things that I love about our marriage.  They work together.  They play together.  They celebrate together, and they can help each other out.  They have each other's backs.

So please raise your glasses and join me in wishing Adrian and Aly the best of luck.

In case you don't know me, I'm Aly's dad.

Thank you all for coming to celebrate Matt and Aly's wedding.  Matt, Aly, and I are very lucky to have such great friends and family.  Many of you have traveled a long way, and want to thank you.

I especially want to thank Matt's parents, Kevin and Leigh for working so hard to make all of this come together and especially Jill and Ed for lending us their house and helping out in so many other ways.

I still remember the day Aly was born.  My parents, Jan and I, and Mike and Bryan were all having lunch at a fast food place called Char-Hut when Jan suddenly said, "It's time to go".  We rushed off to the hospital and only got lost one time before arriving.  Less than an hour later, we met Aly for the first time.  She was a very beautiful baby.

23 years later, I got a phone call from Matt, asking me for Aly's hand in marriage.  A few months after that, Matt was visiting Oregon, and we all climbed Mt. St. Helens together.  On the lip of the volcano, Matt asked Aly to marry him.  And here we are today.  Over the last few months I've had the pleasure of getting to know Matt and his family and to understand what fine people they are.

There's nothing more important than friends and family.  The great thing about weddings is that they mark the creation of a new family and thus make the world a little bit better.  Every time I attend a wedding, I can't help but think back to Jan's and my wedding, to the start of our family; and I realize how much better it's made my life.

Now, Matt and Aly are starting their own adventure. So, please join me in raising your glasses to celebrate the creation of a new family -- To Matt and Aly!
