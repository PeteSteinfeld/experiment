When shit brings you down, just say "Fuck it!" and eat yourself some motherfucking candy.

Bitch, I'm here to tell you that it's gonna be all right.  We'll get through this shit, motherfucker.  Just you wait.

Reince Priebus
On behalf of the entire senior staff around you, Mr. President, we thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you've given us to serve your agenda and the American people.  And we're continuing to work very hard every day to accomplish those goals.

Japanese Toyota executive responding to a positive report by an American manager --
Jim-san, we all know you are a good manager.  Otherwise we would not have hired you.  But please tell us about your problems so we can work on them together.

[2:17] Confucius said: "Yu, shall I teach you about knowledge? What you know, you know, what you don't know, you don't know. This is knowledge."

[6:20] Confucius said: "Knowing it is not as good as loving it; loving it is not as good as delighting in it."

"Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain but it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving." -- Dale Carnegie

[1:6] Confucius said: "A young man should serve his parents at home and be respectful to elders outside his home. He should be earnest and truthful, loving all, but become intimate with humaneness. After doing this, if he has energy to spare, he can study literature and the arts."

Man has three ways of acting wisely. First, on meditation; that is the noblest. Secondly, on imitation; that is the easiest. Thirdly, on experience; that is the bitterest.

Brian Kernighan "The Elements of Programming Style", 2nd edition, chapter 2
Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?

Brian Kernighan
Do what you think is interesting, do something that you think is fun and worthwhile, because otherwise you won't do it well anyway. 

Conan! What is best in life?  To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women. 

Ataraxia was synonymous with the only true happiness possible for a person. It signifies the state of robust tranquility that derives from eschewing faith in an afterlife, not fearing the gods because they are distant and unconcerned with us, avoiding politics and vexatious people, surrounding oneself with trustworthy and affectionate friends and, most importantly, being an affectionate, virtuous person, worthy of trust.

The cowboy code -- 
    If it's not yours, don't take it. 
    If it's not true, don't say it.
    If it's not right, don't do it.

What's the difference between a wedding chapel and a restaurant's daily specials? One is a marrying venue, the other is a varying menu.

An aikido student asked his master, "Master - how is it that you never lose your balance?". The master replied, "I continuously lose my balance. I just regain it faster."

Thida Mam -- When the Khmer Rouge came to power, I was a fifteen year old school girl who cared little about politics and blindly trusted that Pol Pot and others wanted what was best for the people, that they'd fought the corrupted central government in order to fix what was wrong in our society. My first encounter with the Khmer Rouge was one of hostility, deception and violence. At gunpoint, the Khmer Rouge soldiers ordered all of us to leave our homes and abandon the city -- supposedly to escape being bombed by the Americans. We were confused and intimidated, and so, with no apparent compelling reason to resist their orders, we became a nation of homeless refugees overnight. By the time we realised that leaving the city had been a trick to strip us of our homes and our possessions, it was too late to resist. In a matter of days we'd become totally dependent on the Khmer Rouge for rice, for information, for our very survival. 

Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments 
The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life, seems to arise from over-rating the difference between one permanent situation and another. Avarice over-rates the difference between poverty and riches: ambition, that between a private and a public station: vain-glory, that between obscurity and extensive reputation. The person under the influence of any of those extravagant passions, is not only miserable in his actual situation, but is often disposed to disturb the peace of society, in order to arrive at that which he so foolishly admires. The slightest observation, however, might satisfy him, that, in all the ordinary situations of human life, a well-disposed mind may be equally calm, equally cheerful, and equally contented. Some of those situations may, no doubt, deserve to be preferred to others: but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardour which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice; or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds, either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly, or by remorse from the horror of our own injustice.

Mahatma Gandhi

    Autonomy: People want to have control over their work.
    Mastery: People want to get better at what they do.
    Purpose: People want to be part of something that is bigger than they are.
